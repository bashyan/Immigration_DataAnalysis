European Union is based on "economic distance", a level of income set at 60% 
of the median household income

Median income
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Median income is the amount that divides the income distribution into two equal groups, half having income above that amount, and half having income below that amount. Mean income (average) is the amount obtained by dividing the total aggregate income of a group by the number of units in that group.

Median income can be calculated by household income, by personal income, or for specific demographic groups.
